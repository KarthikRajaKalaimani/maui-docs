# Migrating from Xamarin Carousel View to .NET MAUI Carousel View 

To migrate easier from Xamarin `SfCarousel` to .NET MAUI Carousel View, we kept most of the APIs from Xamarin Carousel View in MAUI `SfCarousel`. However, to maintain the consistency of API naming in MAUI `SfCarousel`, we renamed some of the APIs. The APIs that have been changed in MAUI Carousel View from Xamarin Carousel View are detailed as follows.

## Namespaces 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Xamarin SfCarousel</th>
<th>.NET MAUI SfCarousel</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Syncfusion.SfCarousel.XForms</td>
<td>Syncfusion.Maui.Carousel</td></tr>
</table>
