# MAUI Popup (SfPopup) Overview

Popup layout allows you to display an alert message with customizable buttons or load any desired view inside a popup. It provides options to fully customize the popup with custom header, body, and footer capabilities, allowing you to display important information precisely how users want to.

## Key features

* Load complex views and layouts as content.
* Display popups with minimalistic code by calling only a single method.
* Choose from default layouts, such as one-button and two-button layouts, to display simple and minimalistic information.
* Display popups in positions relative to a view on screen.
* Display popups at specific x and y coordinates with desired height and width or with default dimensions in the center.
