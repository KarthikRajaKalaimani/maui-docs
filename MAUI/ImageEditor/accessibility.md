## Accessibility in .NET MAUI Image Editor (SfImageEditor)

The [.NET MAUI Image Editor](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-image-editor) enables users to interact in different ways to help meet their visual, hearing, speech, dexterity, and cognitive needs.

The Image Editor can efficiently interact with toolbar icons and sliders, narrating their names and descriptions.
