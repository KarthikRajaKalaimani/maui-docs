# Overview of .NET MAUI Shimmer (SfShimmer)

Syncfusion .NET MAUI Shimmer (SfShimmer) control can increase an application's responsiveness by displaying a shimmer effect while the content is loading or processing in the background.

## Key features

* **Multiple Shimmer View types**: There are seven different Shimmer view types available in the .NET MAUI `SfShimmer`. The `CirclePersona` view is initially rendered by default.

* **Multiple Shimmer Wave Directions**: It defines the Animation wave direction for the Shimmer. There are five wave directions available in the `SfShimmer`. By default, the wave direction is rendered by the `Default` wave, allowing the animation from the left top to the right bottom.

* **Shimmer Custom view**: `SfShimmerView` supports `ShimmerView`, which can be used in Custom view to change the Shimmer shape types.
